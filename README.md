[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sunnivin/mandelbrot-set-how-fast-can-you-run/HEAD)

In this repo we explore how fast "pure" python, python compined with numpy (wrapping to C) and fortran with python can calculate if a number is in the mandelbrot-set.

## Run
You can either clone this repo and install the requirements with pipenv or click on the binder-icon to run the example with Binder. 
Remember that if you run this example locally you will need an installed fortran compiler in your path.
